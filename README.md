# moon_lander_demo_for_kids
This is a cool moon landing demo for kids.


The demo is made of:
- a lunar lander model with OAK-D stereo cameras to measure distance to ground
- a 1m height frame with cord and pulley so pulling/releasing the coard takes
the lunar lander up \ down
- a servo and a joystick to pull \ release the cord, and thus control
the lander height
- a laptop for user UI and controlling joystick \ lander cameras \ servo in realtime
